# Abstract 

As mobile usage keep growing up, the demand on new software is increasing as well, and in different fields. One of these fields is attendance registration. This project aims to develop an application to monitor students’ attendance during exams and provides synchronization with a backend; our application helps to facilitate the track of exams for controllers (supervisors) to track student attendance. We use Agile methodology to develop this application. This application saves time, applies authentication and prevents forgery, and it can be extended for other areas rather than educational institutions. Near field communication technology is using magnetic fields to send and receive data between two NFC cards; we use NFC technology as it’s now supported by many of smartphones and no need for a specific reader to do the job, and all students have NFC card attached to their ID and we are going to use that card. QAR is a very useful, easy to use and helpful application for controlling and managing exams.
